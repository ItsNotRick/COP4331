## Vision Statement
The goal of this project is to create a phone-based rhythm game in which\
the user input is through physical actions off of the phone: tapping the table\
and clapping.

This rhythm game is for casual players looking for a unique experience.\
The game trades precise input for a more physical style of input with the\
hope that it's fun even for people who don't usually play rhythm games.\
Currently available phone-based rhythm games mostly leverage the touch\
screen as input which can get boring. This isn't a truly novel idea, games\
such as Donkey Konga use a similar input method but there aren't any modern\
games that do this.
