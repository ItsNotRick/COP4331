# Everything below was made early on and needs to be looked at
## Project Outline
For now the focus will be on a phone app, using an arduino or ARM dev board is
also an option if we decide that we need greater control over the microphone.
### Minimum Viable Product:
Rhythm game with a few built in beatmaps running on a phone or an arduino / ARM dev board.

### Where Things Get Interesting (Potential features to work on)
**Priority Level: 1 - 4 higher number = higher impact**
